Question title:Big Achiever
Given N
N students standing in a row, each student i has an distinct achievement score 
A
i
\
  provided in an array 
A
=
[
A
1
,
A
2

…
,
A

]
A=[A

​
 ,A

​
 ,…,A

​
 ]. The array 
A
A consists of distinct integers from 
1
1 to 
N
N.

A student 
i
i ( 
1
≤
i
≤
N
1≤i≤N ) will be happy if their achievement score 
A
i
A 
i
​
  is greater than the achievement scores of all the students standing before them in the array.

The task is to print whether a student is happy or not.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains 
N
N — the number of students.
The second line of each test case contains 
N
N space-separated integers 
A

 , denoting the achievement scores of the students.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing 
N
N integers. Print 
i
t
h
i 
th
  integer as 
1
1 if the 
i
t
h
i 
th
  student is happy, otherwise print 
0
0.

Each test case's output should be on a new line, with the integers separated by spaces.

Explanation:
Test Case 1:

There is no student behind student 
1
1, so he is happy.
For student 
2
2, there is student 
1
1 with greater achievement score, so he is not happy.
Similarly for student 
3
3, there is student 
1
1 with greater score, so he is not happy.
Student 
4
4 has greater achievement score than student 
1
1, student 
2
2, and student 
3
3, so student 
4
4 is happy.
Student 
5
5 has greater score than all other students, so he is happy.


Solution:
